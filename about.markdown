# Academically 
<p markdown="1">
I'm a second-year PhD student at [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, University of Cambridge, in Machine Learning with applications to healthcare and medicine. 
</p>

<p markdown="1">
I'm a part of the [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligince for Medicine](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com){:target="_blank"} (ML-AIM) group supervised by [Professor Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} (DAMTP). 
</p>

<p markdown="1">
Additionally I'm co-supervised by [Aditya Nori](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/adityan/){:target="_blank"} (and previously [Danielle Belgrave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Belgrave){:target="_blank"}) at Microsoft Research through their PhD Scholarship program with which I am funded.
</p>

<p markdown="1">
Previously I completed the Cambridge MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and the BSc in Statistics program at UCL.

# (Maybe) Interestingly

Like many who arrive at Cambridge, I've been sucked into the cult of rowing and currently I'm the Captain of the Wolfson College Boat Club.

Previous to taking up rowing, I trained in [Krav Maga](https://pure-kravmaga.co.uk){:target="_blank"} to the point of being a trainee-instructor. Learning an effective form of self-defence as well as the experience of teaching it pushed me well outside of my comfort zone and to its credit made me far more confident and outgoing.

I'm loosely involved in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org){:target="_blank"} movement, having helped run the society at UCL in my last couple years. Conveniently their focus on safe AI aligns neatly with my research focus.
