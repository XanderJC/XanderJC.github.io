I'm interested in developing safe and robust machine learning systems that behave in the way we expect, making them able to work with humans effectively.
</p>

<p markdown="1">
One aspect of this is understanding decision making agents through imitation and inverse reinforcement learning. A probabilistic perspective allows us to handle the crucial uncertainty surrounding behaviour and as part of my PhD I'm looking to build scalable and well-calibrated Bayesian approximate methods that can bring us key insights and support high-stakes decisions particularly in the medical setting.

<p markdown="1">
I'm also interested in general problems in reward (mis-)specification / hacking / (mis-)generalisation, as well as recently understanding internal concepts in large foundation models.
